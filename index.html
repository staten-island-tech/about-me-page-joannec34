    <h1>About Me Page</h1>
    <h2>HELLO ANYONE WHO READS THIS</h2>
    <p>My name is Joanne Chen. I'm 16 and my birthday is May 8. I have two younger siblings and their names are Jeffery
        and Emily. I would describe myself as an artistic person, and I like to express my creativity through my school
        projects and assignments. I used to draw but I haven't for a while because I've been preoccupied by other
        activities (see freetime list below). I'm completely new to coding and I hope to learn how to create cool and
        pretty websites in this class. I also have two seals named Pablo and Pabla.</p>

    <p>This is Pablo</p>

    <h4>In my freetime I like to</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Play VALORANT</li>
        <li>Listen to music</li>
        <li>Talk to my pro-coder friends: Natalie, Miki, and Darren (You might know them)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>My top 3 favorite things</h4>
